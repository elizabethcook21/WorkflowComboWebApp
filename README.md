# Summary
This is the web application version of the WorkflowCombo command line tool.

# To-Do's
1. Eventually I'd like to allow the user to drag and drop the files they input to determine the order in which they will be organized in the workflow (rather than renaming the files to start with 01, 02, etc..)
2. I'd like to split this webpage down the middle and have the questions on the left side, and a preview of the workflow they're building on the right side (so they know what it looks like)
3. I'd like to tighten the regex for parsing the inputs and outputs of the CWL data. Right now, they're very specific to the somatic example files that Dr. Piccolo provided, but I'd like to write some better regex that matches what ToolJig creates.
